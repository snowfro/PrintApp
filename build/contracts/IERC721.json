There are three types of purchase. One is a print of your Punk\n * accompanied by an NFC that contains the details of your transaction. You may also \n * purchase the NFC by itself if you want to print your own Punk. There is a Misc purchase\n * option as well for a potential future item added to the store.\n * \n * To purchase, confirm the price (in wei) of the item you would like to purchase by\n * calling the pricePer* function in the contract. Next, execute the purchase \n * function for the corresponding item sending the necessary amount in ETH. If you are in \n * the USA the item price includes shipping. There is a price for items shipped\n * internationally so if you are purchasing from outside the USA make sure you send\n * the higher value noted with \"IntlShip\" in the item's variable name. \n * \n * Please also include a contact method in your purchase transaction. You will have to \n * contact us with your mailing address so we know where to send your print! That information \n * must come from the contact method indicated at time of purchase.\n *\n * Prices subject to change without notice.

This does assume however correct usage, in that the underlying `_value` is never\ndirectly accessed.",
