      <h1> Welcome to the Punk Print Registry Store </h1>
      <br />
      <h4>Here you'll be able to purchase authentication for your <a href="https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks">CryptoPunks.</a></h4>
      <br />
      <p>There are two purchase options to choose from:</p>
      <br />
      <ul>
      <li>A 12"x12" (or smaller) high quality print of your Punk with authentication NFC. </li>
      <li>An authentication NFC sticker that you can attatch to a print you already have. </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>You will be transacting directly through the Punk Print Registry Smart Contract. In other words,
      the storefront itself is a smart contract. In order to purchase a Punk print or NFC, <b>you must have ownership
      of that Punk in the Ethereum address <i>that you send the funds from</i></b>.</p>
      <br />
      <p>The Punk Print Registry Store will reject your transaction if you do not send funds from the "owner" address. </p>
      <br />
      <p>In order to maintain your privacy, you will not be sending shipping information to the smart contract along with your transaction.
      Instead you will simply provide a communication method such as an e-mail address or full Discord handle that that we can use to verify
      the source of shipping information.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p> This contact method will be deleted after you receive your print or NFC.</p>
      <br />
      <p> This print registry is operated by Art Blocks, LLC and is not affiliated with or endorsed by the creators of the CryptoPunks project.</p>
